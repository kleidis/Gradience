### Libadwaita applications

No additional setup is required for native Libadwaita applications.

For Flatpak Libadwaita applications, you need to override their permissions:

- Run `sudo flatpak override --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-4.0` or
- Use [Flatseal](https://github.com/tchx84/Flatseal) and adding `xdg-config/gtk-4.0` to **Other files** in the **Filesystem** section of **All Applications**

### Vanilla GTK 4 applications

Use [this guide](https://github.com/lassekongo83/adw-gtk3/blob/main/gtk4.md) to theme vanilla GTK 4 applications.

### GTK 3 applications

- Install and apply the [adw-gtk3](https://github.com/lassekongo83/adw-gtk3#readme) theme (don't forget to install the Flatpak package!)
- For Flatpak applications, you need to override their permissions:
  - Run `sudo flatpak override --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-3.0` or
  - Use [Flatseal](https://github.com/tchx84/Flatseal) and adding `xdg-config/gtk-3.0` to **Other files** in the **Filesystem** section of **All Applications**

## üèóÔ∏è Building from source

First of all, you need to have [GNOME Nightly](https://nightly.gnome.org) Flatpak remote added if it's not already:

```shell
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists gnome-nightly https://nightly.gnome.org/gnome-nightly.flatpakrepo
```

Then, download the Gradience nightly from [here](https://nightly.link/GradienceTeam/Gradience/workflows/build/main)

Finally, extract the ZIP and install Gradience by running:

```shell
flatpak install gradience-devel.flatpak
```

### GNOME Builder

GNOME Builder is the environment used for developing this application.
It can use Flatpak manifests to create a consistent building and running
environment cross-distro. Thus, it is highly recommended you use it.

1. Download [GNOME Builder](https://apps.gnome.org/Builder).
2. In Builder, click the "Clone Repository" button at the bottom, using `https://github.com/GradienceTeam/Gradience.git` as the URL.
3. Click the build button at the top once the project is loaded.

For more building and installation methods, see [HACKING.md](HACKING.md)

## üè∑Ô∏è About the Name

Gradience was originally named Adwaita Manager.

You can see the meaning of Gradience on [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gradience).

The icon represents: _A Paint Roller repainting an Adwaita window, keeping its functionality._

##  üñåÔ∏è About the "Pretty Purple"

The Pretty Purple theme comes from the very beginning, directly from the original author of Gradience, [Artyom Fomin](https://github.com/ArtyIF).

It was called "Purple Guy", presumably as a reference to the FNaF, later it was renamed to Pretty Purple.

Pretty Purple preset was originally shared in the https://github.com/GradienceTeam/Gradience/discussions/23.

Pretty Purple is built-in in the Gradience and used in all Gradience artworks.

## üå±Ô∏è Gradience, [stopthemingmy.app](https://stopthemingmy.app) and Adwaita Developers

> See [gradienceteam.github.io/hack](https://gradienceteam.github.io/hack)

Gradience Team is not against the ideas of [stopthemingmy.app](https://stopthemingmy.app) and the developers of Adwaita. Gradience is a tool for tinkerers who want to theme their desktop to their liking, and **not a tool for distributions** to ship in their releases. Gradience Team agrees with importance of unified look of Adwaita to make sure that all apps function correctly and that developers have a unified and stable tool for creating their apps.
